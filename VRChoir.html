            VRChoir is a Virtual Reality music experience created using ThreeJS, in3D, 
            Blender, and Ableton Live. This project is my first attempt at creating 
            a VR music experience and demonstrates my ability to use a combination of modern 
            technologies, my understanding of 3D geometry, and shows potential 
            for future music 3D experiences.

        <h2> Technologies</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://in3d.io/" target="_blank">in3D</a>  - 3D Scanner</h3>
        I used this mobile app to create digital 3D avatars of
        myself and my two roommates which I exported to edit in Blender.

        <h3><a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> - 3D Creation Software</h3>
        I only wanted 
        the heads of the 3D avatars from in3D so I used Blender
        "chop" the heads off of the avatars
        and exported them as gLTFs to use in ThreeJS.


        <h3><a href="https://www.ableton.com/" target="_blank">Ableton Live</a> - Digital Audio Workstation</h3>
        I used Ableton to sample the various "Swan"s and "Lee"s and pitch shifted
        these samples into different notes in a Sus7 chord to create a virtual ambient choir.

        <h3><a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">ThreeJS</a> - In-browser 3D JavaScript Library</h3>
        ThreeJS allowed me to render this 3D scene on a webpage using
        JavaScript code. The components consist of
        a VR camera, main stage, floating life-like heads, and various lights. 
        I also used
        ThreeJS Positional Audio to attach HTML audio elements to
        the floating heads to give the allusion that each
        head is actually singing from their space in 3D.
