<h1> White Rock Beach in Unreal Engine </h1>
<h2> About </h2>
This project is my first attempt at building anything in Unreal Engine. 
I decided to try to recreate White Rock Beach, a beach that I grew up
near that is close to my heart. This project took approximately a weeks time to build and
I was able to learn the Unreal Engine tools necessary by 
watching YouTube videos on different topics such as materials,
foliage, water systems, lighting, rendering, animation, and more. Please watch
the video below to learn more about my process building this project.
